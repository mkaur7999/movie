## Objective
To develop a efficient and effective model which predicts genre of movie according to user’s inputs.
To achieve good accuracy.
To develop a User Interface( UI ) which is user-friendly and takes input from the user and predicts the genre of movie.

## Overview about the App
The Movie Genre Prediction is a flask web application which predicts genre of the movie. The dataset is available at Kaggle. 

The code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed, you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
